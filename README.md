## Data Preparation
The Financial Dataset covers financial data from September 2013 to December 2014.

Data Profiling: 
- Analyzing the dataset's characteristics and structure involves assessing the quality of the data and examining the distribution of its columns. This process helps ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and appropriately organized for analysis.
- Follow the ETL process, transforming data before loading into Power BI. This includes cleaning data by checking data types, trimming, standardization, etc.

## Data Modeling
Creating relationships: 
- Linking related data across tables allows for easy navigation and aggregation of information.
- Hiding key columns reduces visual clutter, resulting in a cleaner view of information for easier analysis.

## Data Visualization
- Keep it straightforward for your audience. Less is more; focus on what's essential.
- Choose the right chart type: Select charts that best represent your data for clear communication and understanding.
- Observe data-ink ratio: Use visuals effectively; prioritize data over unnecessary elements to enhance clarity.
